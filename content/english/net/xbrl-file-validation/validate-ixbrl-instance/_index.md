In this guide, we'll explore how to validate iXBRL instances using Aspose.Finance for .NET. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be equipped with the knowledge to ensure the integrity of your iXBRL data effortlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before we embark on this tutorial, let's ensure you have everything set up:
### .NET Development Environment
Ensure that you have a .NET development environment configured on your machine. If you haven't already, you can download and install the latest version of the .NET SDK from the official Microsoft website.
### Aspose.Finance for .NET
Download and install Aspose.Finance for .NET from the official download link provided below:
[Download Aspose.Finance for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/finance/net/)
### iXBRL Instance
Prepare an iXBRL instance that you wish to validate using Aspose.Finance for .NET. Make sure you have the file path ready for reference in your code.
## Import Namespaces
Let's start by importing the necessary namespaces into your .NET project to access the functionalities of Aspose.Finance. Follow these step-by-step instructions:
## Step 1: Open Your .NET Project
Begin by launching your .NET project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio.
## Step 2: Add Aspose.Finance Reference
Add a reference to Aspose.Finance for .NET in your project. You can accomplish this by either downloading the library and referencing it locally or using NuGet Package Manager to install it directly into your project.
## Step 3: Import Namespaces
Now, import the required namespaces at the beginning of your code file. These namespaces provide access to the classes and methods needed for working with iXBRL documents.
```csharp
using Aspose.Finance.Xbrl.Inline;
using Aspose.Finance.Xbrl.Validator;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```
## Validate iXBRL Instance
Now that we've set up our environment and imported the necessary namespaces, let's dive into the process of validating an iXBRL instance using Aspose.Finance for .NET. Follow these step-by-step instructions:
## Step 1: Define Source Directory
Start by defining the directory path where your iXBRL instance is located. Replace `"Your Source Directory"` with the actual path to your document.
```csharp
string sourceDir = "Your Source Directory";
```
## Step 2: Create InlineXbrlDocument Object
Next, create an `InlineXbrlDocument` object by providing the path to your iXBRL document.
```csharp
InlineXbrlDocument document = new InlineXbrlDocument(sourceDir + @"account_1.html");
```
## Step 3: Validate iXBRL Instance
Invoke the `Validate()` method on the `InlineXbrlDocument` object to validate the iXBRL instance.
```csharp
document.Validate();
```
## Step 4: Handle Validation Errors (Optional)
If there are validation errors present in the iXBRL instance, retrieve and handle them accordingly.
```csharp
if (document.ValidationErrors.Count > 0)
{
    List<ValidationError> validationErrors = document.ValidationErrors;
    // Handle validation errors here
}
```
## Step 5: Display Success Message
Inform the user that the validation process has been executed successfully.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("ValidateIxbrlInstance executed successfully.");
```
By following these steps, you've successfully validated an iXBRL instance using Aspose.Finance for .NET.
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've explored the process of validating iXBRL instances using Aspose.Finance for .NET. By leveraging the step-by-step guide provided, you can ensure the integrity and compliance of your iXBRL data effortlessly within your .NET applications.
