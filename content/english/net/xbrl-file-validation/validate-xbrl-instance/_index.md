## Introduction
In the realm of financial software development, precision and accuracy are paramount. Developers often encounter the need to work with eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) documents, which contain essential financial data in a structured format. Aspose.Finance for .NET offers a powerful toolkit for handling XBRL documents efficiently within .NET applications. One of its key features is the ability to validate XBRL instances seamlessly. In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve into the process of validating XBRL instances using Aspose.Finance for .NET. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be equipped with the knowledge to ensure the integrity and compliance of your XBRL data effortlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before we proceed with the tutorial, let's ensure you have the necessary setup:
### .NET Development Environment
Firstly, make sure you have a .NET development environment set up on your machine. If you haven't already, you can download and install the latest version of the .NET SDK from the official Microsoft website.
### Aspose.Finance for .NET
Download and install Aspose.Finance for .NET from the official download link provided below:
[Download Aspose.Finance for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/finance/net/)
### XBRL Instance
Prepare an XBRL instance file that you wish to validate using Aspose.Finance for .NET. Ensure that you have the file path ready for reference in your code.
## Import Namespaces
Let's start by importing the necessary namespaces into your .NET project to access the functionalities of Aspose.Finance. Follow these step-by-step instructions:
## Step 1: Open Your .NET Project
Launch your .NET project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio.
## Step 2: Add Aspose.Finance Reference
Add a reference to Aspose.Finance for .NET in your project. You can achieve this by either downloading the library and referencing it locally or using NuGet Package Manager to install it directly into your project.
## Step 3: Import Namespaces
Now, import the required namespaces at the beginning of your code file. These namespaces provide access to the classes and methods needed for working with XBRL documents.
```csharp
using Aspose.Finance.Xbrl;
using Aspose.Finance.Xbrl.Validator;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```
## Validate XBRL Instance
Now that we've set up our environment and imported the necessary namespaces, let's dive into the process of validating an XBRL instance using Aspose.Finance for .NET. Follow these step-by-step instructions:
## Step 1: Define Source Directory
Start by defining the directory path where your XBRL instance file is located. Replace `"Your Source Directory"` with the actual path to your file.
```csharp
string sourceDir = "Your Source Directory";
```
## Step 2: Create XbrlDocument Object
Next, create an `XbrlDocument` object by providing the path to your XBRL instance file.
```csharp
XbrlDocument document = new XbrlDocument(sourceDir + @"IdScopeContextPeriodStartAfterEnd.xml");
```
## Step 3: Access XBRL Instance
Access the XBRL instance from the document using the `XbrlInstances` property.
```csharp
XbrlInstanceCollection xbrlInstances = document.XbrlInstances;
XbrlInstance xbrlInstance = xbrlInstances[0];
```
## Step 4: Validate XBRL Instance
Invoke the `Validate()` method on the `XbrlInstance` object to validate the XBRL instance.
```csharp
xbrlInstance.Validate();
```
## Step 5: Handle Validation Errors (Optional)
If validation errors are present in the XBRL instance, retrieve and handle them accordingly.
```csharp
if (xbrlInstance.ValidationErrors.Count > 0)
{
    List<ValidationError> validationErrors = xbrlInstance.ValidationErrors;
    // Handle validation errors here
}
```
## Step 6: Display Success Message
Inform the user that the validation process has been executed successfully.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("ValidateXbrlInstance executed successfully.");
```
By following these steps, you've successfully validated an XBRL instance using Aspose.Finance for .NET.
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've explored the process of validating XBRL instances using Aspose.Finance for .NET. With the step-by-step guide provided, you can ensure the integrity and compliance of your XBRL data seamlessly within your .NET applications.
