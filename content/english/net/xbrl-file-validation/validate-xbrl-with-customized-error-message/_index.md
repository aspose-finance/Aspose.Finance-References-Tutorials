## Introduction
In the world of financial reporting, accuracy and compliance are non-negotiable. Developers working with eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) documents must ensure that these documents meet all validation requirements to maintain data integrity. Aspose.Finance for .NET offers powerful tools to manage and validate XBRL instances effectively. This comprehensive guide will walk you through validating XBRL documents and customizing error messages using Aspose.Finance for .NET. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have the skills to ensure your XBRL data is accurate and compliant with financial reporting standards.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, let's ensure you have the necessary tools and setup:
### .NET Development Environment
Ensure you have a .NET development environment configured on your machine. If not, download and install the latest version of the .NET SDK from the official Microsoft website.
### Aspose.Finance for .NET
Download and install Aspose.Finance for .NET from the official download link provided below:
[Download Aspose.Finance for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/finance/net/)
### XBRL Instance
Prepare an XBRL instance file that you wish to validate using Aspose.Finance for .NET. Ensure you have the file path ready for reference in your code.
## Import Namespaces
To access the functionalities of Aspose.Finance, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your .NET project. Follow these steps:
## Step 1: Open Your .NET Project
Launch your .NET project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio.
## Step 2: Add Aspose.Finance Reference
Add a reference to Aspose.Finance for .NET in your project. You can do this by downloading the library and referencing it locally or using NuGet Package Manager to install it directly into your project.
## Step 3: Import Namespaces
Import the required namespaces at the beginning of your code file. These namespaces provide access to the classes and methods needed for working with XBRL documents.
```csharp
using Aspose.Finance.Xbrl;
using Aspose.Finance.Xbrl.Validator;
using System;
```
## Validate XBRL with Customized Error Message
Now that we have our environment set up and the necessary namespaces imported, let's dive into the process of validating an XBRL instance and customizing the error messages using Aspose.Finance for .NET.
## Step 1: Define Source Directory
Start by defining the directory path where your XBRL instance file is located. Replace `"Your Source Directory"` with the actual path to your file.
```csharp
string sourceDir = "Your Source Directory";
```
## Step 2: Create XbrlDocument Object
Create an `XbrlDocument` object by providing the path to your XBRL instance file.
```csharp
XbrlDocument document = new XbrlDocument(sourceDir + @"IdScopeContextPeriodStartAfterEnd.xml");
```
## Step 3: Access XBRL Instance
Access the XBRL instance from the document using the `XbrlInstances` property.
```csharp
XbrlInstanceCollection xbrlInstances = document.XbrlInstances;
XbrlInstance xbrlInstance = xbrlInstances[0];
```
## Step 4: Validate XBRL Instance
Invoke the `Validate()` method on the `XbrlInstance` object to validate the XBRL instance.
```csharp
xbrlInstance.Validate();
```
## Step 5: Handle Validation Errors with Customized Messages
If validation errors are present in the XBRL instance, retrieve and handle them, providing customized error messages.
```csharp
if (xbrlInstance.ValidationErrors.Count > 0)
{
    foreach (ValidationError validationError in xbrlInstance.ValidationErrors)
    {
        if (validationError.Code == ValidationErrorCode.ContextPeriodStartAfterEnd)
        {
            ContextValidationError contextValidationError = validationError as ContextValidationError;
            Console.WriteLine("Validation error: end date is before start date in context " + contextValidationError.Object.Id);
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Find validation error: " + validationError.Message);
        }
    }
}
```
## Step 6: Display Success Message
Inform the user that the validation process has been executed successfully.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("ValidateXBRLWithCustomizedErrorMessage executed successfully.");
```
By following these steps, you've successfully validated an XBRL instance and customized error messages using Aspose.Finance for .NET.
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've explored the process of validating XBRL instances using Aspose.Finance for .NET and customizing error messages to provide more detailed and specific feedback. With the step-by-step guide provided, you can ensure the integrity and compliance of your XBRL data effortlessly within your .NET applications.
