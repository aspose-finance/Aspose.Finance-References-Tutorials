## Convert XBRL to iXBRL Using Aspose.Finance for .NET
In today’s data-driven world, financial professionals often need to convert XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) files into iXBRL (Inline XBRL) format to ensure data is both machine-readable and human-readable. If you’re looking for a robust solution to accomplish this, Aspose.Finance for .NET is an excellent choice. This guide will walk you through the process step-by-step, from setting up your environment to successfully converting your files.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the conversion process, let’s go over what you need:
1. Basic Knowledge of .NET: Familiarity with C# and the .NET framework is essential.
2. Aspose.Finance for .NET: You’ll need to download and install the Aspose.Finance for .NET library.
3. XBRL Files: Ensure you have the XBRL files you intend to convert.
4. Development Environment: A .NET development environment like Visual Studio.
## Import Namespaces
To get started, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. This allows you to access the functionalities provided by Aspose.Finance.
```csharp
using Aspose.Finance.Xbrl;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Working Directories
First, you need to specify the directories for your source XBRL files and the output iXBRL files.
```csharp
// Working directories
string sourceDir = "Your Source Directory";
string outputDir = "Your Output Directory";
```
## Step 2: Load the XBRL Document
Next, you’ll load your XBRL document using the `XbrlDocument` class provided by Aspose.Finance.
```csharp
XbrlDocument document = new XbrlDocument(sourceDir + @"IdScopeContextPeriodStartAfterEnd.xml");
```
This line of code initializes a new instance of the `XbrlDocument` class and loads the specified XBRL file.
## Step 3: Set Save Options
To convert the document into a different format, you need to set the save options. For this tutorial, we’ll save the file in iXBRL format.
```csharp
SaveOptions saveOptions = new SaveOptions();
saveOptions.SaveFormat = SaveFormat.iXBRL;
```
Here, `SaveOptions` is used to specify the format in which you want to save the document.
## Step 4: Save the File
Now that everything is set up, you can save the XBRL document as an iXBRL file.
```csharp
document.Save(outputDir + @"ConvertXbrlToiXbrl_out.ixbrl", saveOptions);
```
This command saves the converted file to the specified output directory.
## Step 5: Confirm the Conversion
Finally, you can confirm the conversion by displaying a success message.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("ConvertXbrlToiXbrl executed successfully.");
```
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You’ve successfully converted an XBRL file to iXBRL using Aspose.Finance for .NET. This powerful library simplifies the conversion process, enabling seamless transitions between different financial reporting formats. Whether you’re a developer or a financial professional, mastering this tool will undoubtedly enhance your productivity and efficiency.
