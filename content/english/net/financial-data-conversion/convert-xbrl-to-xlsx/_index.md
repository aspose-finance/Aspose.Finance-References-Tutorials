If you work in finance, you know that handling and analyzing data can sometimes feel like trying to navigate through a dense forest. Luckily, tools like Aspose.Finance for .NET make it easier to convert complex financial data from XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) to more accessible formats like XLSX (Excel Spreadsheet). In this guide, I'll walk you through the entire process step-by-step. By the end, you'll be able to convert XBRL files to XLSX with confidence and ease.
## Prerequisites
Before we get started, letâ€™s make sure you have everything you need:
1. Basic Understanding of .NET: A little familiarity with C# and the .NET framework goes a long way.
2. Aspose.Finance for .NET: You can download and install this library from the Aspose website.
3. XBRL Files: The XBRL files you want to convert.
4. Development Environment: A .NET development environment such as Visual Studio.
## Import Namespaces
First things first, let's import the necessary namespaces into your project. This will give you access to the classes and methods needed for the conversion.
```csharp
using Aspose.Finance.Xbrl;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Working Directories
We need to specify the directories where our source XBRL files are located and where we want to save the converted XLSX files. This setup ensures that our code knows where to find the input files and where to store the output files.
```csharp
// Working directories
string sourceDir = "Your Source Directory";
string outputDir = "Your Output Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Source Directory"` and `"Your Output Directory"` with the actual paths to your directories.
## Step 2: Load the XBRL Document
Next, we load the XBRL document using the `XbrlDocument` class from Aspose.Finance. This step involves reading the XBRL file into the program so that we can manipulate and convert it.
```csharp
XbrlDocument document = new XbrlDocument(sourceDir + @"IdScopeContextPeriodStartAfterEnd.xml");
```
Here, we create an instance of the `XbrlDocument` class and load the specified XBRL file. Make sure the file path is correct.
## Step 3: Set Save Options
To convert the document into XLSX format, we need to set the appropriate save options. This tells the program the format in which we want to save the output file.
```csharp
SaveOptions saveOptions = new SaveOptions();
saveOptions.SaveFormat = SaveFormat.XLSX;
```
In this snippet, we create a `SaveOptions` object and set its `SaveFormat` property to `XLSX`, indicating that we want to save the file in Excel format.
## Step 4: Save the File
Now, we save the XBRL document as an XLSX file. This step converts the file and writes it to the specified output directory.
```csharp
document.Save(outputDir + @"ConvertXbrlToXlsx_out.xlsx", saveOptions);
```
This command saves the converted file in the output directory with the name `ConvertXbrlToXlsx_out.xlsx`.
## Step 5: Confirm the Conversion
Finally, to confirm that the conversion was successful, we print a message to the console.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("ConvertXbrlToXlsx executed successfully.");
```
This message lets you know that the conversion process has been completed without errors.
## Conclusion
And there you have it! By following these simple steps, you can easily convert XBRL files to XLSX using Aspose.Finance for .NET. This process not only saves time but also makes your financial data more accessible and easier to analyze in Excel. Whether you're a developer or a financial analyst, mastering this conversion can significantly streamline your workflow.
