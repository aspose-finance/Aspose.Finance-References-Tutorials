## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
## Create a New Project
Start by creating a new C# project in your development environment. For Visual Studio, follow these steps:
1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Select `File` > `New` > `Project`.

## Step 2: Load the OFX Response File
Load the OFX response file that you want to convert. Ensure the file is stored in a directory on your computer.
```csharp
// Specify the source directory where your OFX response file is located
string sourceDir = "Your Source Directory";
// Load the OFX response document from the specified file
OfxResponseDocument document = new OfxResponseDocument(sourceDir + @"bankTransactionRes.sgml");
```
## Explanation
- sourceDir: This is the directory path where your OFX response file is located. Replace `"Your Source Directory"` with the actual path.
- OfxResponseDocument: This class loads the OFX response file into a document object for further processing.
## Step 3: Convert the OFX Response File to OFX Response V2
Now that the document is loaded, convert it to OFX Response V2. This step involves saving the document in the new format.

// Specify the output directory where the converted file will be saved
string outputDir = "Your Output Directory";
// Save the document in OFX Response V2 format
document.Save(outputDir + @"bankTransactionRes.xml", OfxVersionEnum.V2x);
```
## Explanation
- outputDir: This is the directory path where the converted OFX file will be saved. Replace `"Your Output Directory"` with the actual path.
- Save Method: The `Save` method saves the document in the specified format. The second parameter specifies the OFX version to which you want to convert the file (OFX V2 in this case).
## Step 4: Verify the Conversion
